# CI/CD
CI/CD is a word that comes up a lot related to DevOps and Backend jobs, and for good reason; so I started learning and using it myself. I started out using GitHub Actions on my private Flutter Project to build and deploy a new release.

[**Flutter**](https://github.com/Akisan98/CI-CD/tree/main/Flutter) - The Flutter WorkFlow will run the project, build the APKs (Split per abi) and deploy them as a new release on the GitHub Repository.
